I couldn't find any documentation on it perhaps I missed it, or was searching for wrong keywords ...\r\n\r\nThe input is a line, from a log:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"date\": \"2021/02/25 11:14:59\",\r\n  \"FRITZ!DECT 301 #3\": {\r\n    \"name\": \"FRITZ!DECT 301 #3\",\r\n    \"battery\": \"30\",\r\n    ....\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nI want to see the date and the \"battery\" status, which is produced as strings with the following filter:\r\n[(.date) , .[].battery?](https://jqplay.org/s/m2dr0MvjLa)\r\n\r\nSuppose we want to return it as an array we would change it too:\r\n[[(.date) , .[].battery? ]](https://jqplay.org/s/-07JwNNdis)\r\nOr as an object:\r\n[{(.date) : .[].battery? }](https://jqplay.org/s/JOZp_fkeIW)\r\n\r\nI wanted to use an if statement, instead of the '?' construct, so first for the array output, which works fine:\r\n[[ .[] | if type == \"object\" then .battery else . end ]](https://jqplay.org/s/z_hkAB-B99)\r\nHere the confusion started when I tried to output an object, as my first attempt, changing '[' to '}' brackets, gave a compile error:\r\n[{ .[] | if type == \"object\" then .battery else . end }](https://jqplay.org/s/Pm_2tHuzAg)\r\n\r\nAfter quite some research the following seemed to be the correct way to generate an object:\r\n[{ (.date) : (.[] | if type == \"object\" then  .battery  else empty end) }](https://jqplay.org/s/lNXdAS_FP8) \r\n\r\nSo while implicit expanding to an array works fine with an 'if' construct, it fails for expanding to an object. Only when we explicitly force it to the \":\" format the output succeeds. The \"asymmetry\" is unexpected, at least by me :-), and I think  should be documented or perhaps if possible repaired. The man page and its examples, do seems to \"state\" that the {,} and [,] constructs are symmetric. Of course the problem arises here because we need {:}, which is also in the '{}' manual topic.\r\n\r\np.s. Big fan of jq! Great how it e.g. allows to handle complex data structures in 'bash' by storing \"json\" data in shell variables...","performed_via_github_app":null}

Essentially, OSS-Fuzz is a free service run by Google that performs continuous fuzzing of important open source projects. The only expectation of integrating into OSS-Fuzz is that bugs will be fixed. This is not a \"hard\" requirement in that no one enforces this and the main point is if bugs are not fixed then it is a waste of resources to run the fuzzers, which we would like to avoid.\r\n\r\nIn this PR https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/pull/4980 I have done exactly that, namely created the necessary logic from an OSS-Fuzz perspective to integrate jq. If you would like to integrate, could you please provide a set of email(s) that will get access to the data produced by OSS-Fuzz, such as bug reports, coverage reports and more stats. The emails should be linked to a Google account in order to view the detailed reports and notice the emails affiliated with the project will be public in the OSS-Fuzz repo, as they will be part of a configuration file.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}

I'm reaching here but hear me out, please.\r\n\r\n`jq --lda lamda \"echo ${sampled} | jq -s '.[].Maps[!].Value'\" -r '.[]' <(web-api --id $lambda)`\r\n\r\nI realise that this is really stretching things, maybe a bit too far.  I'm expecting to hear the snap at any moment.\r\n\r\nThe way that I imagine this would work. The primary jq instance in lambda mode would set an environmental variable as named by the label after the flag.  The lambda instance steps through its data structure where the `THIS` operator occurs. Each step returning the result to the named variable (without the `THIS` operator the lambda instance would only have one step).  The primary calling jq instance runs for that step and append its result set to its final output.  The lambda operation only completing once the lambda instance has exhausted its data structure.\r\n\r\nAnother term other than lambda may be more appropriate?\r\n\r\nEquivalent to bash:\r\n`for row in $(echo \"$sampled\" | jq -sr '.[].Maps[].Value') ; do`\r\n`      jq -s '.[]' <(web-api id=$row);`\r\n`done`\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time read this.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nStephen.","performed_via_github_app":null}

Technically this is also applicable to the minute and hour components, though I have never seen that used in the wild.\r\n\r\n`fromdateiso8601` doesn't handle fractional seconds, which is an annoyance since I have several JSON applications that emit them, and where I'd like to do some date comparisons.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```shell\r\n] jq -nr '\"2020-12-11T01:00:52.605001Z\" | fromdateiso8601'\r\njq: error (at <unknown>): date \"2020-12-11T01:00:52.605001Z\" does not match format \"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`jq(1)` would parse fractional seconds; ideally, it would also carry and emit them, but just ignoring the fraction would be sufficient for my needs.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - macOS 10.15.7 x64\r\n - `jq-1.6`\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis is definitely an extension on the basic POSIX time functions, so perhaps isn't interesting to jq.  I'd hope it was, since they are fairly commonly used, but I understand if this is bounced as \"not interested\".\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}

I'm using file ~/.jq as a default module for \"always\" functions, so it's not possible to put loadables in ~/.jq/\r\n\r\nI have noted performance behavior that differs from what is stated or suggested in the documentation under Modules:\r\n\r\n> The default search path is the search path given to the -L command-line option, else [\"~/.jq\", \"$ORIGIN/../lib/jq\", \"$ORIGIN/../lib\"].\r\n\r\nI find this not to be the case, at least with regard to the third.  jq -n 'get_search_list' returns:\r\n\r\n> [\r\n>   \"~/.jq\",\r\n>   \"$ORIGIN/../lib/jq\",\r\n>   \"$ORIGIN/lib\"\r\n> ]\r\n\r\nAlso, the following from Modules is either wrong or quite misleading:\r\n\r\n> For paths starting with \"$ORIGIN/\", the path of the jq executable is substituted for \"$ORIGIN\".\r\n\r\nMy jq executable is located at /usr/bin, which is in my $PATH, so I invoke it with simply \"jq\".  As a result, jq returns the following values for 'get_jq_origin' and 'get_prog_origin':\r\n\r\n> \".\"\r\n> \"/forms\"\r\n\r\n(The second, /forms, was my cwd at the time.)\r\n\r\nSo, at least in this environment with this version of jq, the only remotely concrete location that could be used by default for a library of modules is ~/.jq/ -- which eliminates the possibility of automatically loading a module by default upon every invocation, which is very important to me.  Under the circumstances, $ORIGIN is useless if it only takes an explicit path from the command line and not the ultimate found location of the binary, which seems to be what was intended....\r\n\r\nFinally, the way that 'import' and 'include' have been written to use only RelativePath precludes (in every attempt I have made) trying to indicate an absolute path for the module, in favor of \"helping\" me by using a broken search-path scheme.  This leaves as about the only alternative using an explicit -L to point at my module library on every invocation of jq -- of course I could alias that in, but aliases are not usually set in non-interactive shell invocations of scripts, raising a whole extra level of inconvenience and inconsistent operation/invocation depending on runtime context.\r\n\r\nIf I'm missing some really simple solution(s), I'd love for someone to make me feel foolish and point it out.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.  At some point, if I can find the time, I'm going to try to dig up some source for this and see if I can figure out how to fix it, but my C-fu is a little rusty....\r\n\r\n-Mike B\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}

This seems to me to be the only way to have `strflocaltime` printing the correct time zone information on values during a daylight saving time.\r\n\r\nThe following behaviour demonstrates how the daylight savings value gets\r\nlost when a time value gets turned into an internal array of numbers and\r\nthen back into a (struct tm):\r\n\r\n        $ TZ=Europe/London ./jq -r -n '1504803635 | strflocaltime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S (%Z)\")'\r\n        2017-09-07 18:00:35 (GMT)\r\n\r\nAfter this change however, this works as expected:\r\n\r\n        $ TZ=Europe/London ./jq -r -n '1504803635 | strflocaltime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S (%Z)\")'\r\n        2017-09-07 18:00:35 (BST)\r\n\r\n(the only difference is in the `%Z` value - \"BST\" instead of the incorrect \"GMT\").","performed_via_github_app":null}
